# Active Directory Home Lab

A hands-on Active Directory home lab demonstrating enterprise-level domain configuration, user management, and Group Policy implementation using Windows Server Core and VirtualBox/VMware Fusion.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project demonstrates the setup and configuration of a functional Active Directory environment using Windows Server Core as a domain controller. The lab showcases core AD administration skills including domain services installation, organizational unit structure, user management, and group policy configuration.

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Hardware Setup
Due to hardware limitations, this lab utilizes a multi-device setup:

- **Dell Laptop**: Hosts Windows 10 VM (VirtualBox) - Domain member machine
- **MacBook**: Hosts Windows Server Core (VMware Fusion Pro) - Domain Controller

### Network Configuration

**Domain Controller (Windows Server Core)**:
- Platform: VMware Fusion Pro
- IP Configuration: Static IP address
- DNS Server: 8.8.8.8 (Google Public DNS)
- Role: Primary DNS server for the domain

**Client Machine (Windows 10)**:
- Platform: VirtualBox
- VM Name: `vboxuser`
- DNS Configuration: Pointed to Domain Controller's IP address
- Purpose: Enables domain name resolution and AD authentication

This DNS configuration ensures:
- DC can resolve external domains via Google DNS
- Client machines resolve internal domain resources through the DC
- Proper domain join and authentication functionality

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Virtualization**: 
  - VMware Fusion Pro (macOS)
  - Oracle VirtualBox (Windows)
- **Operating Systems**:
  - Windows Server Core (Domain Controller)
  - Windows 10 (Client Machine)
- **Active Directory Components**:
  - Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)
  - Remote Server Administration Tools (RSAT)
  - Active Directory Users and Computers (ADUC)
  - Group Policy Management

## 📋 Implementation Steps

### 1. Domain Controller Setup (Server Core)

**Installed Windows Server Core** on VMware Fusion Pro and configured it as the domain controller using PowerShell/Command line:

```powershell
# Installed Active Directory Domain Services
Install-WindowsFeature AD-Domain-Services -IncludeManagementTools

# Promoted server to Domain Controller
Install-ADDSForest -DomainName "yourdomain.local"
```

**Network Configuration**:
```powershell
# Configured static IP address
New-NetIPAddress -InterfaceAlias "Ethernet" -IPAddress 192.168.1.10 -PrefixLength 24 -DefaultGateway 192.168.1.1

# Set DNS to Google Public DNS for external resolution
Set-DnsClientServerAddress -InterfaceAlias "Ethernet" -ServerAddresses "8.8.8.8"
```

### 2. Domain Member Configuration

**Windows 10 VM Setup** (VirtualBox):
- Created Windows 10 VM named `vboxuser`
- **Configured DNS**: Set DNS server to Domain Controller's IP address (critical for domain operations)
- Joined the VM to the newly created domain
- **Installed RSAT** (Remote Server Administration Tools) using PowerShell:

```powershell
# Install all RSAT tools on Windows 10
Get-WindowsCapability -Name RSAT* -Online | Add-WindowsCapability -Online
```

- Logged in with domain Administrator credentials
- Verified RSAT installation by accessing Active Directory Users and Computers (ADUC)

**Why DNS Configuration Matters**:
- Client machines must use the DC as their DNS server
- This enables domain name resolution and location of domain controllers
- Without proper DNS configuration, domain join and authentication will fail

**RSAT Tools Enabled**:
- Active Directory Users and Computers (dsa.msc)
- Active Directory Administrative Center
- Group Policy Management Console (GPMC)
- DNS Management tools
- Other AD administration utilities

### 3. Organizational Unit (OU) Structure

Created a logical OU hierarchy for organizational management:

```
Domain Root
├── Bangalore (Location-based OU)
├── Pune (Location-based OU)
└── Sales (Department-based OU)
```

**Purpose**: Segregate users and computers by location and department for granular policy application and administrative delegation.

### 4. User Management

**Created Test Users**:
- Username: `Jos Root`
- Created within appropriate OU structure
- Validated authentication by logging in with new credentials

**Verification Process**:
- Successfully logged into domain-joined machine using `Jos Root` credentials
- Confirmed user profile creation and domain authentication

### 5. Group Policy Configuration

**Challenge**: Group Policy Management Console (GPMC) not available on Server Core

**Solution**: Demonstrated policy concepts using Local Group Policy Editor on client machine

```cmd
# Opened Local Group Policy Editor
gpedit.msc

# Applied system-level policies
# Forced policy refresh
gpupdate /force
```

**Policies Implemented**:

#### Interactive Login Message
- **Policy Path**: `Computer Configuration > Windows Settings > Security Settings > Local Policies > Security Options`
- **Configured**: Interactive logon message text and title
- **Purpose**: Display custom message and title to users attempting to login
- **Use Case**: Security warnings, acceptable use policies, or welcome messages

#### Removable Storage Restrictions
- **Policy Path**: `Computer Configuration > Administrative Templates > System > Removable Storage Access`
- **Configured**: Denied access to removable drives
- **Purpose**: Prevent unauthorized data transfer via USB drives
- **Security Benefit**: Data loss prevention and endpoint security

#### Policy Application
- Successfully applied policies using `gpupdate /force`
- Verified policy enforcement through user login testing
- Demonstrated understanding of policy precedence and scope

## 💡 Key Learnings

### Technical Skills Developed
- ✅ Windows Server Core command-line administration
- ✅ Active Directory Domain Services installation and configuration
- ✅ DNS configuration and troubleshooting in AD environments
- ✅ Static IP configuration via PowerShell
- ✅ Cross-platform virtualization (VMware Fusion + VirtualBox)
- ✅ Domain joining and authentication processes
- ✅ OU design and implementation
- ✅ User account creation and management via ADUC
